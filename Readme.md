# User Registration Form

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains a **User Registration Form** built with semantic HTML5.  
The form demonstrates the use of accessible, structured form elements based on provided specifications.

## 🎯 Purpose
The form is designed to:
- Collect **personal information** (name, age, gender, photo, DOB)  
- Record **contact & address details** (email, phone, website, address, country, ZIP, preferred time)  
- Capture **preferences & interests** (favorite color, experience, birth month, week availability, interests, education, password)  
- Gather **feedback & additional information** (about section, suggestions, source, resume upload, agreements)

## 🛠️ Implementation Notes
- **Semantic HTML5** is used (`fieldset`, `legend`, `label`, `input`, `textarea`, `select`).  
- Each form element is properly labeled for **accessibility**.  
- Input types (`email`, `date`, `tel`, `url`, `range`, `color`, `search`, `file`) are used according to their semantic meaning.  
- Includes **validation attributes** (`required`, `min`, `max`, `accept`).  
- No CSS or external styling is applied (structure only).  
- Password confirmation is included for better user experience.
